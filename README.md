# Douglas Adams Bot - interaction through speech.

### speech to text, custom gpt template, text to speech. #OpenAI API.

Simple question-answering CLI bot that can run using CLI. 

The script uses speech recognition to listen to a query from a user.
The audio is then transcribed and then passed to a custom Douglas Adams themed openai call.
The response is received and processed to audio as 'doug-adams-onyx.mp3' (as it uses the onyx voice).

to run simply: 

``` python speech_to_gpt.py ```
